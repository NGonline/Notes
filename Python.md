# Python

## Philosophy
- Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages. Interpreters read a high-level program and execute it a little at a time. Compilers read the program and translate it completely into the object code (or the executable) before the program starts running.
- Python programs are executed by an interpreter. There are two ways to use the interpreter: interactive mode and script mode.
