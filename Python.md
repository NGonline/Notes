# Python

# Philosophy
- Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages. Interpreters read a high-level program and execute it a little at a time. Compilers read the program and translate it completely into the object code (or the executable) before the program starts running.
- Python programs are executed by an interpreter. There are two ways to use the interpreter: interactive mode and script mode.

# Basics

## Values and Types
- If you are not sure what type a value has, the interpreter can tell you: `type(1.7)`.
- Integer with a leading zero is octonary.
- `exec` is no longer a keyword in Python 3, but `nonlocal` became one.
- In Python 3, the result of `59/60` is a float. The new operator `//` performs floor division.
